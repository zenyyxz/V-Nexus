**Last Updated:** December 7, 2024

## Introduction

V-Nexus ("we", "our", or "the application") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our VPN client application.

## Information We Collect

### Information We DO NOT Collect

V-Nexus is designed with privacy as a core principle. We **do not** collect, store, or transmit:

- Your browsing history or internet activity
- DNS queries or website visits
- Connection logs or timestamps
- IP addresses (source or destination)
- Bandwidth usage statistics
- Personal identification information
- Email addresses or contact information
- Payment information (as the application is free)

### Information Stored Locally

The following information is stored **only on your device** and never transmitted to external servers:

- **VPN Server Configurations**: Server addresses, ports, and connection protocols you configure
- **Application Settings**: Your preferences for DNS, routing, proxy settings, and UI customization
- **Device ID**: A randomly generated UUID stored locally for application identification
- **Connection Statistics**: Real-time bandwidth and connection data displayed in the UI (not logged or persisted)

All local data is stored using your browser's localStorage and can be cleared at any time through the application settings.

## How We Use Information

Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not use, share, or sell any user data. The application operates entirely on your local device.

## Third-Party Services

The application does not integrate any:

- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Tracking pixels or cookies
- Third-party data collection tools

## Data Security

- All VPN server credentials and configurations are stored locally on your device
- Passwords are stored in your browser's localStorage (we recommend using encrypted storage features if available)
- The application uses industry-standard encryption protocols (TLS/SSL) for VPN connections
- No data is transmitted to V-Nexus developers or any third parties

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Deletion**: Use the "Erase Client Data" option in Settings > Advanced > VPN Management to delete all local data
